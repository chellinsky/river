<p>The "R.I.V.E.R." name comes from one of City Year's founding stories, "Up the River."</p>
<p>Below is the story.  As time progresses, hopefully the story of R.I.V.E.R. will be contained there as well.</p>
<hr />
<h3>UP THE RIVER</h3>
<p>There once were two villages built on the banks of a wide river.  Over the years, the villages grew in size and became known as Upriver village and Downriver vilalge.</p>
<p>One day, the people of Downriver village saw a man from Upriver village drifting down the river, calling our for help.  Quickly, two of them jmped in and saved him.  the next day, three more people from Upriver cam floating by, and the Downriverites again dove in and saved the three floundering people.  These incidents begain to occur every day.</p>
<p>Finally, enterprising members of Downriver village organized a rescue service.  The rescued Upriverites were always happy to pay the Downriverites for their efforts.  Soon, the rescue service became a thriving industry in the village.</p>
<p>One afternoon, a young boy whose family was new in Downriver asked a question no one in town had wanted to raise:  "How come people from Upriver are always falling in the river and almost drowning?"  He asked one of the Upriverites, who had just been saved by the Downriver people.</p>
<p>"Our ton is built along a cliff," the Upriverite answered, "and whenever it rains, lots of people slip into the river.  Only a few children and none of the adults in town know how to swim, but we are grateful for the way people in this village save us."</p>
<p>The boy went to a town leader.  "Why don't we help the people of Upriver build a fence along their cliff so they don't fall in?" he asked.</p>
<p>The leader told the boy to be quiet and not to worry.  "we know how to rescue people, but we aren't expert fence-builders.  What happens if we don't do a good job building the fence and soemone falls through it?  We would be responsible.  This system works, everyone is happy with it and no one is drowning.  It is better to leave well enough alone."</p>
<p>So the boy went to a worker at the Downriver Village Rescue Service.  "Why don't we teach the people in the village of Upriver how to swim?" he asked.</p>
<p>The worker shook his head.  "That's not our job.  Our job is to rescue people from the water.  Our people are trained to rescue people, not teach people how to swim.  What if we don't teach them properly--someone might drown and there will be no one to rescue them."</p>
<p>The boy felt a bit discouraged.  He thought his plans had been good, but there were no adults who would listen to his ideas.  He sat down on the riverbank and put his head in his hand, staring into the current.  Then a voice asked, "Why do you look so sad?"</p>
<p>A girl from Upriver village stood nearby.  The boy explained that he was sad becuase people kept falling in the river, but no one in his town would do anything to solve the problem.  The girl listened carefully, and then said, "Well, I'm a good swimmer and I've seen you swimming in the river.  Why don't we start some swimming lessons, ourselves?"  At this, the boy grew excited.  He ran around Downriver village, collecting all his friends, and the girl went to Upriver village and brought together her friends.  They began to teach their friends how to swim.</p>
<p>Soon, the children of Upriver and Downriver were excitedly telling their parents about the swimming lessons they had started.  More and more children joined in each day, and one day, some adults came by and they joined in the lessons, as well.  Soon, many of the people falling into the river could swim to safety, but the boy and girl felt that as long as people were falling into the river, there was more work to be done.</p>
<p>So the children went up the river and asked their friends and families to come and help build a fence along the edge of the cliff.  They built a strong fence that stood as a barrier between the village and the river.</p>
<p>From that day forward, very few people fell in the river, and those who did almost all knew how to swim.</p>

<h3>Archived Roadmap</h3>
	<p>At this stage, it will be good to go for trial use with all our volunteers.  To v0.2: (June 1, 2005)</p>
	<ul>
	<li><s>Display volunteers assigned to projects when editing a project and allow them to be removed from a project at that point</s></li>
	<li>Create reports including, but not limited to, <s>list of volunteers for a project including all pertinent information related to that volunteer, sign-in sheets,</s> labels, RASL exports, and project briefing sheets</li>
	<li><s>Make the form elements match the expected input (i.e. correct sizing of the input fields...)</s></li>
	<li><s>Allow excel exports of volunteer data for each project -- serves as a means to get by until R.I.V.E.R. automates all tasks</s></li>
	<li><s>Be able to "finalize" a project</s></li>
	<li><s>Super-cool and dynamic logo/graphic</s></li>
	<li>Show assigned projects when editing volunteers (similar to volunteers appearing on project edit screens)</li>
	<li>Fix the following bugs:<br>
	<ul><li><s>allow sorting of the edit fields;</s></li>
	   <li><s>fix cookie issues with the edit fields--on the second try...grumble;</s></li>
	   <li>check unique with volunteer/project addition;</li>
	   <li><s>time displays wrong when in half-hour increments;</s></li>
	   <li>fix the add proj/vol stuff that I broke one fateful afternoon--just need to make it so they can be edited again;</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><s>Improved navigation (submenus)</s></li>
    <li>Participant area (i.e. camper database)</li>
	</ul>

  <p>To v0.3: (August 31, 2005)</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Management of Signature Service Partner information</li>
  <li>Tutorial system for learning all the ins, outs, and what-have-yous of R.I.V.E.R.</li>
	<li>Optimization of logic in and of functions themselves. A lot of improvement opportunities exist, I just need to sit down and make them once everything works.
		<ul><li>Store more user data in tables rather than cookies</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>More advanced search features when looking for volunteers to edit; add this to another function to just create lists of volunteers for export or enjoyment</li>
	<li>Full templating of html and allow it to be all gussied up--including full CSS and improved graphic generation</li>
	<li>Improved user management like the ability to add users via R.I.V.E.R. and different users access modes</li>
	<li>Service Parnter area</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>v0.4 will need some more stuff.  It is all to be determined.</p>
	<p>v0.5 will add features for volunteers themselves to manage their volunteering, like signing up for projects and maintaining their information.  This will require an overhaul of the authentication proceedure, so I am putting it off as long as possible.</p>
	<p>That is the roadmap as it stands right now.  I will maintain this list as time progresses and likely add quite a bit to it.</p>

	<p>Information from former milestones are located below:</p>

	<p>To v0.1:</p>

	<ul>
	<li>Be able to edit the volunteers and projects users search for</li>
	<li>Ability to delete volunteers and projects--more functionality than exists in current system</li>
	<li>Add additional information like emergency contacts to the users</li>
	<li>Edit emergency information</li>
	<li>Get a good name</li>
	<li>Assign volunteers to projects (this one seems like it will be the most difficult programming and logically)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>To v0.1.1:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Clean up and organize code and functions</li>
	<li>Make the "Sure you want to delete?" javascript work</li>
	</ul>
