To Install RIVER follow these steps (I have yet to try a cold install, so these may or may not work).

1.  Unpack all files to the desired directory on your webserver
2.  Create the database structure using river.sql
3.  Create user accounts in the river_users table
4.  You should be ready to log-in and begin using the system.

Please report any problems to the bug tracking system at http://sourceforge.net/projects/r-i-v-e-r/
